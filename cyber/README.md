## micro test：
### 1to1,1toN,Nto1...
### how to use：
- S.cc is a Timer，it sends a msg every intervel ms，C.cc is the Receiver，it receives msg from S.cc and record the transfer time.
- 1t1: ./run1t1.sh \[1t1_t or 1t1_p\] \[index\] \[msg size\]
- 1tn: 

### for developer
- S.cc reads the msg size and channel topic name from param\[S's node name\].txt which is generated by run.sh（example: 1024 c0，means 1024byte per msg，published in c0 topic），the publish frequency is defined in the field "interval" in .dag，units ms；the topic name that C.cc subscribes is defined in .dag，set the field: readers.channel to /c0 could receive msg from c0，if C is to receive from multi-channels, you need to change C's class struct and related Proc，see C.cc，and .dag needs changes too.
- before running：customize .dag, if communicate between threads（using intra）, put S and C in one dag，different process should be in different dag；then create a .launch file to use these dags, then customize a .conf file for each process with "process_name" in .launch；if you change some code in cyber, recompile in /apollo by running `./apollo.sh build_cyber`
- after running one script，it will create some param\[\*\].txt，then copy some files like 1t1*.conf to /apollo/cyber/conf/, finally it will run \*.launch to start.
- the results are stored in /apollo/data/log/test/tmp，each topic subscribed by each subscriber will have a record file，it is recommended to move the recording files to another place once you finised a round，每次运行都会把上一次的tmp给清空。
- 目前该目录下提供了1t1和1tn两个例子，根据它们做一些修改就可以了。
## 真实场景测试：
- 概述：YoloDetect.cc,Line.cc,CameraTimer.cc,TrackerApollo.cc,FusionFinal.cc分别对应了不同的应用：物体检测、寻线、图片数据产生器、追踪、数据整合。顺序为从CameraTimer产生数据，YoloDetect\Line\TrackerApollo处理这些数据，处理结果汇总到FusionFinal。传输的数据格式定义都在detect_msg.proto中
- TODO
